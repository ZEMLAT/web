<h2>Prices used for orders</h2>

<p>Prices for regular orders can be controlled via the parameter structures <code>bid_strategy</code> for buying and <code>ask_strategy</code> for selling.
Prices are always retrieved right before an order is placed, either by querying the exchange tickers or by using the orderbook data.</p>

<p>!!! Note
    Orderbook data used by Freqtrade are the data retrieved from exchange by the ccxt's function <code>fetch_order_book()</code>, i.e. are usually data from the L2-aggregated orderbook, while the ticker data are the structures returned by the ccxt's <code>fetch_ticker()</code>/<code>fetch_tickers()</code> functions. Refer to the ccxt library <a href="https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt/wiki/Manual#market-data">documentation</a> for more details.</p>

<p>!!! Warning "Using market orders"
    Please read the section <a href="#market-order-pricing">Market order pricing</a> section when using market orders.</p>

<h3>Buy price</h3>

<h4>Check depth of market</h4>

<p>When check depth of market is enabled (<code>bid_strategy.check_depth_of_market.enabled=True</code>), the buy signals are filtered based on the orderbook depth (sum of all amounts) for each orderbook side.</p>

<p>Orderbook <code>bid</code> (buy) side depth is then divided by the orderbook <code>ask</code> (sell) side depth and the resulting delta is compared to the value of the <code>bid_strategy.check_depth_of_market.bids_to_ask_delta</code> parameter. The buy order is only executed if the orderbook delta is greater than or equal to the configured delta value.</p>

<p>!!! Note
    A delta value below 1 means that <code>ask</code> (sell) orderbook side depth is greater than the depth of the <code>bid</code> (buy) orderbook side, while a value greater than 1 means opposite (depth of the buy side is higher than the depth of the sell side).</p>

<h4>Buy price side</h4>

<p>The configuration setting <code>bid_strategy.price_side</code> defines the side of the spread the bot looks for when buying.</p>

<p>The following displays an orderbook.</p>

<p><code>explanation
...
103
102
101  # ask
-------------Current spread
99   # bid
98
97
...
</code></p>

<p>If <code>bid_strategy.price_side</code> is set to <code>"bid"</code>, then the bot will use 99 as buying price. <br />
In line with that, if <code>bid_strategy.price_side</code> is set to <code>"ask"</code>, then the bot will use 101 as buying price.</p>

<p>Using <code>ask</code> price often guarantees quicker filled orders, but the bot can also end up paying more than what would have been necessary.
Taker fees instead of maker fees will most likely apply even when using limit buy orders.
Also, prices at the "ask" side of the spread are higher than prices at the "bid" side in the orderbook, so the order behaves similar to a market order (however with a maximum price).</p>

<h4>Buy price with Orderbook enabled</h4>

<p>When buying with the orderbook enabled (<code>bid_strategy.use_order_book=True</code>), Freqtrade fetches the <code>bid_strategy.order_book_top</code> entries from the orderbook and uses the entry specified as <code>bid_strategy.order_book_top</code> on the configured side (<code>bid_strategy.price_side</code>) of the orderbook. 1 specifies the topmost entry in the orderbook, while 2 would use the 2nd entry in the orderbook, and so on.</p>

<h4>Buy price without Orderbook enabled</h4>

<p>The following section uses <code>side</code> as the configured <code>bid_strategy.price_side</code>.</p>

<p>When not using orderbook (<code>bid_strategy.use_order_book=False</code>), Freqtrade uses the best <code>side</code> price from the ticker if it's below the <code>last</code> traded price from the ticker. Otherwise (when the <code>side</code> price is above the <code>last</code> price), it calculates a rate between <code>side</code> and <code>last</code> price.</p>

<p>The <code>bid_strategy.ask_last_balance</code> configuration parameter controls this. A value of <code>0.0</code> will use <code>side</code> price, while <code>1.0</code> will use the <code>last</code> price and values between those interpolate between ask and last price.</p>

<h3>Sell price</h3>

<h4>Sell price side</h4>

<p>The configuration setting <code>ask_strategy.price_side</code> defines the side of the spread the bot looks for when selling.</p>

<p>The following displays an orderbook:</p>

<p><code>explanation
...
103
102
101  # ask
-------------Current spread
99   # bid
98
97
...
</code></p>

<p>If <code>ask_strategy.price_side</code> is set to <code>"ask"</code>, then the bot will use 101 as selling price. <br />
In line with that, if <code>ask_strategy.price_side</code> is set to <code>"bid"</code>, then the bot will use 99 as selling price.</p>

<h4>Sell price with Orderbook enabled</h4>

<p>When selling with the orderbook enabled (<code>ask_strategy.use_order_book=True</code>), Freqtrade fetches the <code>ask_strategy.order_book_top</code> entries in the orderbook and uses the entry specified as <code>ask_strategy.order_book_top</code> from the configured side (<code>ask_strategy.price_side</code>) as selling price.</p>

<p>1 specifies the topmost entry in the orderbook, while 2 would use the 2nd entry in the orderbook, and so on.</p>

<h4>Sell price without Orderbook enabled</h4>

<p>When not using orderbook (<code>ask_strategy.use_order_book=False</code>), the price at the <code>ask_strategy.price_side</code> side (defaults to <code>"ask"</code>) from the ticker will be used as the sell price.</p>

<p>When not using orderbook (<code>ask_strategy.use_order_book=False</code>), Freqtrade uses the best <code>side</code> price from the ticker if it's below the <code>last</code> traded price from the ticker. Otherwise (when the <code>side</code> price is above the <code>last</code> price), it calculates a rate between <code>side</code> and <code>last</code> price.</p>

<p>The <code>ask_strategy.bid_last_balance</code> configuration parameter controls this. A value of <code>0.0</code> will use <code>side</code> price, while <code>1.0</code> will use the last price and values between those interpolate between <code>side</code> and last price.</p>

<h3>Market order pricing</h3>

<p>When using market orders, prices should be configured to use the "correct" side of the orderbook to allow realistic pricing detection.
Assuming both buy and sell are using market orders, a configuration similar to the following might be used</p>

<p><code>jsonc
  "order_types": {
    "buy": "market",
    "sell": "market"
    // ...
  },
  "bid_strategy": {
    "price_side": "ask",
    // ...
  },
  "ask_strategy":{
    "price_side": "bid",
    // ...
  },
</code></p>

<p>Obviously, if only one side is using limit orders, different pricing combinations can be used.</p>

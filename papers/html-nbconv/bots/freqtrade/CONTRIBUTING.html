<h2>Contribute to freqtrade</h2>

<p>Feel like our bot is missing a feature? We welcome your pull requests! </p>

<p>Issues labeled <a href="https://github.com/freqtrade/freqtrade/labels/good%20first%20issue">good first issue</a> can be good first contributions, and will help get you familiar with the codebase.</p>

<p>Few pointers for contributions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create your PR against the <code>develop</code> branch, not <code>stable</code>.</li>
<li>New features need to contain unit tests, must conform to PEP8 (max-line-length = 100) and should be documented with the introduction PR.</li>
<li>PR's can be declared as <code>[WIP]</code> - which signify Work in Progress Pull Requests (which are not finished).</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are unsure, discuss the feature on our <a href="https://discord.gg/p7nuUNVfP7">discord server</a> or in a <a href="https://github.com/freqtrade/freqtrade/issues">issue</a> before a Pull Request.</p>

<h2>Getting started</h2>

<p>Best start by reading the <a href="https://www.freqtrade.io/">documentation</a> to get a feel for what is possible with the bot, or head straight to the <a href="https://www.freqtrade.io/en/latest/developer/">Developer-documentation</a> (WIP) which should help you getting started.</p>

<h2>Before sending the PR</h2>

<h3>1. Run unit tests</h3>

<p>All unit tests must pass. If a unit test is broken, change your code to 
make it pass. It means you have introduced a regression.</p>

<h4>Test the whole project</h4>

<p><code>bash
pytest
</code></p>

<h4>Test only one file</h4>

<p><code>bash
pytest tests/test_&lt;file_name&gt;.py
</code></p>

<h4>Test only one method from one file</h4>

<p><code>bash
pytest tests/test_&lt;file_name&gt;.py::test_&lt;method_name&gt;
</code></p>

<h3>2. Test if your code is PEP8 compliant</h3>

<h4>Run Flake8</h4>

<p><code>bash
flake8 freqtrade tests scripts
</code></p>

<p>We receive a lot of code that fails the <code>flake8</code> checks.
To help with that, we encourage you to install the git pre-commit 
hook that will warn you when you try to commit code that fails these checks. 
Guide for installing them is <a href="http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/using-hooks.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3>3. Test if all type-hints are correct</h3>

<h4>Run mypy</h4>

<p><code>bash
mypy freqtrade
</code></p>

<h3>4. Ensure all imports are correct</h3>

<h4>Run isort</h4>

<p><code>bash
isort .
</code></p>

<h2>(Core)-Committer Guide</h2>

<h3>Process: Pull Requests</h3>

<p>How to prioritize pull requests, from most to least important:</p>

<ol>
<li>Fixes for broken tests. Broken means broken on any supported platform or Python version.</li>
<li>Extra tests to cover corner cases.</li>
<li>Minor edits to docs.</li>
<li>Bug fixes.</li>
<li>Major edits to docs.</li>
<li>Features.</li>
</ol>

<p>Ensure that each pull request meets all requirements in the Contributing document.</p>

<h3>Process: Issues</h3>

<p>If an issue is a bug that needs an urgent fix, mark it for the next patch release.
Then either fix it or mark as please-help.</p>

<p>For other issues: encourage friendly discussion, moderate debate, offer your thoughts.</p>

<h3>Process: Your own code changes</h3>

<p>All code changes, regardless of who does them, need to be reviewed and merged by someone else.
This rule applies to all the core committers.</p>

<p>Exceptions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Minor corrections and fixes to pull requests submitted by others.</li>
<li>While making a formal release, the release manager can make necessary, appropriate changes.</li>
<li>Small documentation changes that reinforce existing subject matter. Most commonly being, but not limited to spelling and grammar corrections.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Responsibilities</h3>

<ul>
<li>Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Windows, Mac &amp; Linux.</li>
<li>Ensure no malicious code is introduced into the core code.</li>
<li>Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.</li>
<li>Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.</li>
<li>Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. See the Python Community Code of Conduct (https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Becoming a Committer</h3>

<p>Contributors may be given commit privileges. Preference will be given to those with:</p>

<ol>
<li>Past contributions to Freqtrade and other related open-source projects. Contributions to Freqtrade include both code (both accepted and pending) and friendly participation in the issue tracker and Pull request reviews. Quantity and quality are considered.</li>
<li>A coding style that the other core committers find simple, minimal, and clean.</li>
<li>Access to resources for cross-platform development and testing.</li>
<li>Time to devote to the project regularly.</li>
</ol>

<p>Being a Committer does not grant write permission on <code>develop</code> or <code>stable</code> for security reasons (Users trust Freqtrade with their Exchange API keys).</p>

<p>After being Committer for some time, a Committer may be named Core Committer and given full repository access.</p>

<p>Textual data is an essential alternative data source. One example of textual information is transcripts of earnings calls where executives do not only present the latest financial results, but also respond to questions by financial analysts. Investors utilize transcripts to evaluate changes in sentiment, emphasis on particular topics, or style of communication.</p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: different from all other examples, the code is written to run on a host rather than using the Docker image because it relies on a browser. The code has been tested on Ubuntu and Mac only. </p>

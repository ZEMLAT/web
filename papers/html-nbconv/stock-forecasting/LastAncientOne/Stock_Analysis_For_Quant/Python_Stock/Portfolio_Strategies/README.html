<h1>Portfolio Management</h1>

<p>Portfolio management is the art and science of selecting and overseeing a group of investments such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and options that meet the long-term financial objectives and risk tolerance. Create differenty type of portfolio and invest in multiple stocks that affect during that year. For example, invest in stocks that have big impact during coronavirus time. However, it requires the ability to weigh strengths and weaknesses. Therefore, it involves trade-offs, from debt versus equity to domestic versus international and growth versus safety.  </p>

<h2>Key Elements of Portfolio Management</h2>

<ul>
<li>Asset Allocation: <br />
The process of creating and balancing your investment portfolio.   </li>
<li>Diversification: <br />
The process of allocating capital in a way that reduces the exposure to any one particular asset or risk.  </li>
<li>Rebalancing: <br />
The process of realigning the weightings of a portfolio of assets.  </li>
<li>Active Portfolio Management: <br />
The process of making specific investments with the goal of outperforming an investment benchmark index or target return.  </li>
</ul>

<h1>Capital asset pricing model (CAPM)</h1>

<p>Capital asset pricing model is a model used to determine the relationship between systematic risk and expected return for assets such as stocks.  Also, CAPM make decisions about adding assets to a well-diversified portfolio.  </p>

<h1>CAPM Formula</h1>

<h2>Ra = Rf + [(B x (Rm-Rf)]</h2>

<h4>Ra = Expected return on a security</h4>

<h4>Rf = Risk-free rate</h4>

<h4>B = Beta of the security</h4>

<h4>Rm = Expected return of the market</h4>

<p>:small<em>blue</em>diamond: Appraisal Ratio - is a measurement of a fund's return per unit risk. (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/appraisalratio.asp)  </p>

<p>:small<em>blue</em>diamond: Bernardo Ledoit Ratio - is a measurement of the maximum gain-loss ratio. (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1209.6439.pdf)   </p>

<p>:small<em>blue</em>diamond: Burke Ratio - is a measurement of a drawdown based with risk-adjusted performance. (https://breakingdownfinance.com/finance-topics/performance-measurement/burke-ratio/)  </p>

<p>:small<em>blue</em>diamond: Calmar Ratio - is a measurement of drawdown. (https://breakingdownfinance.com/finance-topics/performance-measurement/calmar-ratio/)  </p>

<p>:small<em>blue</em>diamond: Conditional Sharpe Ratio - is a measurement of statistical ordinates of conditional stochastic dominance (CSD) that measure lower partial risk-adjusted excess returns of an asset with respect to return distribution on the benchmark. (https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2489764)  </p>

<p>:small<em>blue</em>diamond: Gain Loss Ratio - is a measurment of how a trading strategy or system is performing. (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profit<em>loss</em>ratio.asp)  </p>

<p>:small<em>blue</em>diamond: Information Ratio - is a measurement of an investment compared to a benchmark index. (Wiki)  </p>

<p>:small<em>blue</em>diamond: Kappa Three Ratio - is a measurement of risk-oadjusted performance that calculates downside risk. (https://breakingdownfinance.com/finance-topics/performance-measurement/kappa-ratio/)    </p>

<p>:small<em>blue</em>diamond: Martin Ratio - is a measurement of safe return and the higher the ratio the better performance. Martin Ratio is the same as Ulcer index. (Wiki)    </p>

<p>:small<em>blue</em>diamond: Modigliani Ratio - is a measurement of the risk-adjusted returns of investment portfolio. (Wiki)  </p>

<p>:small<em>blue</em>diamond: Omega Ratio - is a measurement of risk-return performance and it measures the investment asset, portfolio, or strategy. (Wiki)  </p>

<p>:small<em>blue</em>diamond: Pain Ratio - is a measurement of return vs risk trade off metric. The ratio compares the add value over the risk-free rate against depth, duration, and frequency of losses. (https://www.styleadvisor.com/resources/statfacts/pain-ratio)</p>

<p>:small<em>blue</em>diamond: Risk-adjusted return on capital (RAROC) is a risk-basesd probability measurement for analyzing risking-adjusted financial performance. (Wiki)  </p>

<p>:small<em>blue</em>diamond: Risk-return ratio is to compare the expected returns of an investment with the amount of risk they must undertake to earn these returns. (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskrewardratio.asp)  </p>

<p>:small<em>blue</em>diamond: Sterling Ratio (SR) - is a measurement of the risk-adjusted return of an investment portfolio. However, it measures the return over average drawdown. (Wiki)  </p>

<p>:small<em>blue</em>diamond: Sharpe Ratio - Commonly Used.  Sharpe ratio measures the performance of an investment compared to a risk-free asset, after adjusting for its risk. It is defined as the difference between the returns of the investment and the risk-free return, divided by the standard deviation of the investment. (Wiki) </p>

<p>:small<em>blue</em>diamond: Sortino Ratio - is a measurement similar to Sharpe ratio; on the other hand, is at differentiates harmful volatility from total overall volatility by using the asset's standard deviation of negative portfolio returns. (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sortinoratio.asp)  </p>

<p>:small<em>blue</em>diamond: Stutzer Index Ratio - is a measurement of investment performance benchmark that penalizes underperformance against a benchmark. (https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=239540)  </p>

<p>:small<em>blue</em>diamond: Treynor Ratio - is a measurement of reward-t-volatility ratio; as a result, it determines how much excess return was generated for reach unit of risk taken on by a portfolio. (Wiki)  </p>

<p>:small<em>blue</em>diamond: Upside Potential Ratio - is a measurement of a return of an investment asseet relative to the minimal acceptable return. (Wiki)  </p>

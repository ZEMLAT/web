<p><img src="RegressionAnalysisR.PNG"></p>

<h3>Regression Analysis is a statistical method that explore the relationship between two or more variables. There many different types of regression analysis; however, they all have one or more independent variables on a dependent variable.</h3>

<h3>MSE, MAE, RMSE, and R-Squared metrics are mainly used to evaluate the prediction error rates and model performance in regression analysis.</h3>

<p>| MSE / RSME | MAE| R2| 
| ----------------------- | ------------- | -------------| 
| Based on square of error      | Based on absolute value of error | Based on correlation between actual and predicted value|
| Value lies between 0 to infinity | Value lies between 0 to infinity  | Value lies between 0 and 1 |
| Sensitive to outliers, punishes larger error more | Treat larger and small errors equally. Not sensitive to outliers | Not sensitive to outliers |
| Small value indicates better model | Small value indicates better model | Value near 1 indicates better model |</p>

<h3>Mean Squared Error (MSE)</h3>

<p>Mean Square Error (MSE) is a mean or average of the square of the difference between actual and estimated values. <br />
Equations: <br />

<p>MSE = mean squared error <br />
n = number of data points <br />
y<em>i = observed vales <br />
y ̂</em>i = predicted values  </p>

<h3>Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)</h3>

<p>Root Mean Square Error (MSE) is the residual (difference between prediction and truth) for each data point, compute the norm of residual for each data point, compute the mean of residuals and take the square root of that mean. <br />

<p>Information theory studies the quantification of information, its storage, and communication. There are two concepts that are used to construct a decision tree using ID3 algorithm is called information entropy and information gain.    </p>

<h3>Ridge Regression</h3>

<p>Ridge Regression is algorithm that used to analyses any data that suffers from multicollinearity and it performs L2 regularization. If the multicollinearity occurs in the model, least-squares are unbiased, and variances are large. Therefore, results in predicted values to be far away from the actual values.  </p>

<h1>The minimum backtest length and the deflated SR</h1>

<p>Lopez de Prado and Bailey (2014) also derive a deflated SR to compute the probability that the SR is statistically significant while controlling for the inflationary effect of multiple testing, non-normal returns, and shorter sample lengths.</p>

<h2>Code exapmle</h2>

<p>The script <a href="deflated_sharpe_ratio.py">deflated<em>sharpe</em>ratio</a> contains the commented implementation made available by Marcos Lopez de Prado on his website. </p>

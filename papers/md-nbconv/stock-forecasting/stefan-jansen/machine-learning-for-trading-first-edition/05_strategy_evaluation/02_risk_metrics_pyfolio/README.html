<h2>How to build and test a portfolio with zipline</h2>

<p>Pyfolio facilitates the analysis of portfolio performance and risk in-sample and out-of-sample using many standard metrics. It produces tear sheets covering the analysis of returns, positions, and transactions, as well as event risk during periods of market stress using several built-in scenarios, and also includes Bayesian out-of-sample performance analysis.</p>

<p>The demonstration in the notebook <a href="pyfolio_demo.ipynb">pyfolio<em>demo</a> relies on data generated by the notebook <a href="../01_trading_zipline/alpha_factor_zipline_with_trades.ipynb">alpha</em>factor<em>zipline</em>with<em>trades</a> in the directory <a href="../01_trading_zipline">trading</em>zipline</a>. </p>

<p>Run the following from the command line to create a conda environment with zipline and pyfolio:</p>

<p>```
conda env create -f environment.yml</p>

<p>```
This assumes you have <a href="https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html">miniconda3</a> installed.</p>

<h2>Engineering alpha factors</h2>

<p>Based on a conceptual understanding of key factor categories, their rationale and popular metrics, a key task is to identify new factors that may better capture the risks embodied by the return drivers laid out previously, or to find new ones.</p>

<h3>Useful pandas and NumPy methods</h3>

<p>NumPy and pandas are the key tools for custom factor computations. The Notebook <a href="feature_engineering.ipynb">feature_engineering</a> contains examples of how to create various factors. </p>

<p>The notebook uses data generated by the notebook <a href="../../data/create_datasets.ipynb">create_datasets</a> script in the data folder in the root directory of this GitHub repo and stored in HDF5 format for faster access. </p>

<p>See the notebook <a href="../../02_market_and_fundamental_data/04_storage_benchmark/storage_benchmark.ipynb">storage_benchmarks</a> in the directory for Chapter 2, Market and Fundamental Data for a comparison of parquet, HDF5, and csv storage formats for pandas DataFrames.</p>

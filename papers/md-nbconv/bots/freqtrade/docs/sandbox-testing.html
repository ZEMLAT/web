<h1>Sandbox API testing</h1>

<p>Some exchanges provide sandboxes or testbeds for risk-free testing, while running the bot against a real exchange.
With some configuration, freqtrade (in combination with ccxt) provides access to these.</p>

<p>This document is an overview to configure Freqtrade to be used with sandboxes.
This can be useful to developers and trader alike.</p>

<p>!!! Warning
    Sandboxes usually have very low volume, and either a very wide spread, or no orders available at all.
    Therefore, sandboxes will usually not do a good job of showing you how a strategy would work in real trading.</p>

<h2>Exchanges known to have a sandbox / testnet</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://testnet.binance.vision/">binance</a></li>

<h2>Configure a Sandbox account</h2>

<p>When testing your API connectivity, make sure to use the appropriate sandbox / testnet URL.</p>

<p>In general, you should follow these steps to enable an exchange's sandbox:</p>

<ul>
<li>Figure out if an exchange has a sandbox (most likely by using google or the exchange's support documents)</li>
<li>Create a sandbox account (often the sandbox-account requires separate registration)</li>
<li><a href="#add-test-funds">Add some test assets to account</a></li>
<li>Create API keys</li>
</ul>

<h3>Add test funds</h3>

<p>Usually, sandbox exchanges allow depositing funds directly via web-interface.
You should make sure to have a realistic amount of funds available to your test-account, so results are representable of your real account funds.</p>

<p>!!! Warning
    Test exchanges will <strong>NEVER</strong> require your real credit card or banking details!</p>

<h2>Configure freqtrade to use a exchange's sandbox</h2>

<h3>Sandbox URLs</h3>

<p>Freqtrade makes use of CCXT which in turn provides a list of URLs to Freqtrade.
These include <code>['test']</code> and <code>['api']</code>.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>[Test]</code> if available will point to an Exchanges sandbox.</li>
<li><code>[Api]</code> normally used, and resolves to live API target on the exchange.</li>
</ul>

<p>To make use of sandbox / test add "sandbox": true, to your config.json</p>

<p><code>json
  "exchange": {
        "name": "coinbasepro",
        "sandbox": true,
        "key": "5wowfxemogxeowo;heiohgmd",
        "secret": "/ZMH1P62rCVmwefewrgcewX8nh4gob+lywxfwfxwwfxwfNsH1ySgvWCUR/w==",
        "password": "1bkjfkhfhfu6sr",
        "outdated_offset": 5
        "pair_whitelist": [
            "BTC/USD"
        ]
  },
  "datadir": "user_data/data/coinbasepro_sandbox"
</code></p>

<p>Also the following information:</p>

<ul>
<li>api-key (created for the sandbox webpage)</li>
<li>api-secret (noted earlier)</li>
<li>password (the passphrase - noted earlier)</li>
</ul>

<p>!!! Tip "Different data directory"
    We also recommend to set <code>datadir</code> to something identifying downloaded data as sandbox data, to avoid having sandbox data mixed with data from the real exchange.
    This can be done by adding the <code>"datadir"</code> key to the configuration.
    Now, whenever you use this configuration, your data directory will be set to this directory.</p>

<hr />

<h2>You should now be ready to test your sandbox</h2>

<p>Ensure Freqtrade logs show the sandbox URL, and trades made are shown in sandbox. Also make sure to select a pair which shows at least some decent value (which very often is BTC/<somestablecoin>).</p>

<h2>Common problems with sandbox exchanges</h2>

<p>Sandbox exchange instances often have very low volume, which can cause some problems which usually are not seen on a real exchange instance.</p>

<h3>Old Candles problem</h3>

<p>Since Sandboxes often have low volume, candles can be quite old and show no volume.
To disable the error "Outdated history for pair ...", best increase the parameter <code>"outdated_offset"</code> to a number that seems realistic for the sandbox you're using.</p>

<h3>Unfilled orders</h3>

<p>Sandboxes often have very low volumes - which means that many trades can go unfilled, or can go unfilled for a very long time.</p>

<p>To mitigate this, you can try to match the first order on the opposite orderbook side using the following configuration:</p>

<p><code>jsonc
  "order_types": {
    "buy": "limit",
    "sell": "limit"
    // ...
  },
  "bid_strategy": {
    "price_side": "ask",
    // ...
  },
  "ask_strategy":{
    "price_side": "bid",
    // ...
  },
</code></p>

<p>The configuration is similar to the suggested configuration for market orders - however by using limit-orders you can avoid moving the price too much, and you can set the worst price you might get.</p>

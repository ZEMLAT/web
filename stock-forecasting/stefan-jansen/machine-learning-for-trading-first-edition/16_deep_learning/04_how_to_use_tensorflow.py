# # How to use TensorFlow 2.0

# TensorFlow has become the leading deep learning library shortly after its release in September 2015, one year before PyTorch. TensorFlow 2.0 aims to simplify the API that has grown increasingly complex over time by making the Keras API, integrated into TensorFlow as part of the contrib package since 2017 its principal interface, and adopting eager execution. It will continue to focus on a robust implementation across numerous platforms but will make it easier to experiment and do research.

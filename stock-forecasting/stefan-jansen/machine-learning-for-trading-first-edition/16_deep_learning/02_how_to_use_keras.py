# # How to use Keras

# Keras was designed as a high-level or meta API to accelerate the iterative workflow when designing and training deep neural networks with computational backends like TensorFlow, Theano, or CNTK. It has been integrated into TensorFlow in 2017 and is set to become the principal TensorFlow interface with the 2.0 release. You can also combine code from both libraries to leverage Keras’ high-level abstractions as well as customized TensorFlow graph operations.

# Please follow the installations instructions in `Installation Guide.md` in the root folder.

               markers=['_', '+']);


# ## Build Keras Model

# Keras supports both a slightly simpler Sequential and more flexible Functional API. We will introduce the former at this point and use the Functional API in more complex examples in the following chapters.
# 
# To create a model, we just need to instantiate a Sequential object and provide a list with the sequence of standard layers and their configurations, including the number of units, type of activation function, or name. 

# ### Define Architecture

# In[9]:


model = Sequential([
    Dense(units=3, input_shape=(2,), name='hidden'),
    Activation('sigmoid', name='logistic'),
    Dense(2, name='output'),
    Activation('softmax', name='softmax'),
])


# The first hidden layer needs information about the number of features in the matrix it receives from the input layer via the input_shape argument. In our simple case, these are just two. Keras infers the number of rows it needs to process during training, through the batch_size argument that we will pass to the fit method below. 
# 
# Keras infers the sizes of the inputs received by other layers from the previous layer’s units argument.

# Keras provides numerous standard building blocks, including recurrent and convolutional layers, various options for regularization, a range of loss functions and optimizers, and also preprocessing, visualization and logging (see documentation on GitHub for reference). It is also extensible.
# 
# The model’s summary method produces a concise description of the network architecture, including a list of the layer types and shapes, and the number of parameters:

# In[10]:


model.summary()


# ## Compile Model

# Next, we compile the Sequential model to configure the learning process. To this end, we define the optimizer, the loss function, and one or several performance metrics to monitor during training:

# In[11]:


model.compile(optimizer='rmsprop',
              loss='binary_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])


# ## Tensorboard Callback

# Keras uses callbacks to enable certain functionality during training, such as logging information for interactive display in TensorBoard (see next section):

# In[12]:


tb_callback = TensorBoard(log_dir='./tensorboard', 
                          histogram_freq=1, 
                          write_graph=True, 
                          write_images=True)


# ## Train Model

# To train the model, we call its fit method and pass several parameters in addition to the training data:

# In[13]:


model.fit(X, 
          Y, 
          epochs=25,
          validation_split=.2,
          batch_size=128, 
          verbose=1, 
          callbacks=[tb_callback])


# ## Get Weights

# In[14]:


hidden = model.get_layer('hidden').get_weights()


# In[15]:


[t.shape for t in hidden]


# ## Plot Decision Boundary

# The visualization of the decision boundary resembles the result from the manual network implementation. The training with Keras runs a multiple faster, though.

# In[16]:


n_vals = 200
x1 = np.linspace(-1.5, 1.5, num=n_vals)
x2 = np.linspace(-1.5, 1.5, num=n_vals)
xx, yy = np.meshgrid(x1, x2)  # create the grid


# In[17]:


X_ = np.array([xx.ravel(), yy.ravel()]).T


# In[18]:


y_hat = np.argmax(model.predict(X_), axis=1)


# In[19]:


# Create a color map to show the classification colors of each grid point
cmap = ListedColormap([sns.xkcd_rgb["pale red"],
                       sns.xkcd_rgb["denim blue"]])

# Plot the classification plane with decision boundary and input samples
plt.contourf(xx, yy, y_hat.reshape(n_vals, -1), cmap=cmap, alpha=.25)

# Plot both classes on the x1, x2 plane
data = pd.DataFrame(X, columns=['$x_1$', '$x_2$']).assign(Class=pd.Series(y).map({0:'negative', 1:'positive'}))
sns.scatterplot(x='$x_1$', y='$x_2$', hue='Class', data=data, style=y, markers=['_', '+'], legend=False)
plt.title('Decision Boundary');
